          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Serkadis Dubale, Born and raised in Ethiopia (<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"
              >Reference to Ethiopia</a
            >) located in East Africa. I am passionate about computer science &
            software engineering. My passion for computer science can be traced
            back to my childhood in Ethiopia. I was fascinated on how computer
            really work. With my limited access to technology and resources
            pursuing my passion was delayed. Coming to the United States and
            having the opportunity to pursue a career in software engineer at
            Cisco I get to innovate and live my American dream. In my free time
            I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, and doing outdoor
            activities. Just last year I hike Grand Canyon.
