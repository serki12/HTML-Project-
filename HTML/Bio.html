                    <h1>Biography</h1> 
                    <p> Hi, my name is Serkadis Dubale, 
                    and I am passionate about computer science/software 
                    engineering. My passion for computer science can be traced 
                    back to my childhood in Ethiopia. Born and raised in East Africa,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"><p>Click Here</p></a>
                    I was fascinated on how computer really work. With my limited access
                    to technology and resources pursuing my passion was delayed. Coming to
                    the United States and having the opportunity to pursue a career in software
                    engineer at Cisco I get to innovate and live my American dream. In my free time
                    I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, and doing outdoor activities. Just last
                    year I hike Grand Canyon.</p>
